# $$\Huge{\textsf{\color{rgba(44,144,226,1)} Michael Terry's ePortfolio}}$$

*Hello!, my name is Michael Terry. I've earned my B.S. in Computer Science: Software Engineering over the course of 5 years, with the first 3 1/2 years at Mt. San Antonio Community College in Walnut, California, and the last 1 1/2 year at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout my time at both schools, I've developed various projects in different programming languages and databases which include C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and MongoDB. These projects cover a range of software development skills and techniques which include, application design, algorithms and data structures, CRUD operations, utilizing secure coding techniques, unit  testing, exception handling, input validation, and  reverse engineering undocumented legacy code to recreate a new secure and applications. By collaborating with classmates and colleagues, these projects granted me experience with the different phases of the Software Development Lifecycle within an Agile-Scrum project management structure. This ePortfolio will contain various projects that highlight these skills and techniques. There is also a link to each project directory that conatins the program source code and a downloadable executable to run the program.*

### $\large{\textsf{\color{rgba(226,223,44,1)}\textit{Corner Grocer}}}$
- The Corner Grocer program is a menu-based program that begins by reading a data file that contains a list of grocery items and their quantity. The user will have the option to search for one item, print all items and their quantity, and print a histogram of all items and their quantity. This project focuses on design techniques, data structures, exception handling, file management, and container lists.
