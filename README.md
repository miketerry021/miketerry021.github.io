# $${\color{blue}\text{Michael Terry's ePortfolio}}$$
*The purpose of this ePortfolio is to highlight my skils, abilities, and experience as a Software Engineer at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). The contents included are 3 projects from the following categories: Software Design and Engneering, Algorithms and Data Structures, Databases. Also included is a professional self-assessment, link to a code review for the 3 projects, and the targeted course outcomes for my Capstone course to complete my Computer Science B.S. program.*

By completing the planned enhancements for each artifact, I have successfully met the targeted course outcomes outlined in the Capstone cousre at SNHU. Here is a list of the course outcomes:

- Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.
- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
