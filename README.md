# $$\Huge{\textsf{\color{rgba(44,144,226,1)} Michael Terry's ePortfolio}}$$

*Hello!, my name is Michael Terry. I've earned my B.S. in Computer Science: Software Engineering over the course of 5 years, with the first 3 1/2 years at Mt. San Antonio Community College in Walnut, California, and the last 1 1/2 year at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout my time at both schools, I've developed various projects in different programming languages and databases which include C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and MongoDB. These projects cover a range of software development skills and techniques which include, application design, algorithms and data structures, CRUD operations, utilizing secure coding techniques, unit  testing, exception handling, input validation, and reverse engineering undocumented legacy code to recreate a new secure and applications. By collaborating with classmates and colleagues, these projects granted me experience with the different phases of the Software Development Lifecycle within an Agile-Scrum project management structure. This ePortfolio will contain various projects that highlight these skills and techniques. There is also a link to each project directory that conatins the program source code and a downloadable executable to run the program.*

- $\small{\textsf{Here is a link to my Resume:}}$ [Developer Resume](https://github.com/miketerry021/miketerry021.github.io/blob/cf877eb126255737b23c63af95abd87a047d2800/Developer%20Resume.pdf)

### $\large{\textsf{\color{rgba(226,223,44,1)}\textit{Airgead Banking}}}$
- The Airgead Banking program is a menu-based program that will calculate a compound interest investment plan based parameters entered by the user: initial deposit, monthly deposit, interest rate, and number of investment years. This project highlights menu design formatting techniques, input validation, and mathematical calculation.

### $\large{\textsf{\color{rgba(226,223,44,1)}\textit{Corner Grocer}}}$
- The Corner Grocer program is a menu-based program that begins by reading a data file that contains a list of grocery items, and generating a new file containing the items quantity. The user will have the option to search for one item, print all items and their quantity, or print a histogram of all items. This project highlights menu design techniques, data structures, exception handling, file management, input validation, and container lists.

### $\large{\textsf{\color{rgba(226,223,44,1)}\textit{Courses ABCU}}}$
- The Courses ABCU program is a menu-based program that begins by reading a data file that contains a list of courses, course ID's, and course prerequisites. The user will have the option to display all courses, or look up an individual course and its prerequisites. This project highlights menu design techniques, data structures, exception handling, file management, input validation and utilization of both selection sort and binary search tree algorithms.

### $\large{\textsf{\color{rgba(226,223,44,1)}\textit{Coffee Shop}}}$
- The Coffee Shop program is a simulation of a coffee shop POS system. Once started, the user will add a customer name, drink type, and drink quantity to an order. Once the order is finished, the sales total is calculated and displayed. This project highlights application design with JSwing, input validation, and mathematical calculation.

### $\large{\textsf{\color{rgba(226,223,44,1)}\textit{Ice Cream Shop}}}$
- The Ice Cream Shop program is a simulation of an ice cream shop POS system. Once started, the user can enter either the Sales or Administrator windows. In Sales, the user can fill a customer by selecting an ice cream flavor, portion size, number of scoops, and quantity. Once the order is finished, the sales total is calculated and displayed. In Administrator, the user can add new or delete ice cream flavors. This project highlights application design with JSwing, input validation, and mathematical calculation.

### $\large{\textsf{\color{rgba(226,223,44,1)}\textit{Inventory App}}}$
- The Inventory App is an Android app the is designed to simulate an asset management system, specifically for an IT department. The app has an SQLite database with tables for user accounts and items. When launched, a user will need to login with their user account, or create a new account, to gain access to the app. Once access has been granted, a user will be able to add, modify, delete, and display items. While the app's design is minimal, the purpose of this project was to highlight an ability to develop and integrat a working application with a database, as well as demonstrate CRUD operations.
